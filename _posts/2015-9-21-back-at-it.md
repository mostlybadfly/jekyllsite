I recently had some great conversations with people related to the learning and different ways in which we acquire new knowlege/skills.  A friend also sent me this great post on passion and the learning process: [hacking passion](http://www.kytrinyx.com/blog/hacking-passion). I have been thinking a lot about my  own progress and how I've been teaching myself.

In my experience with learning web development, I often forget the steps of practice, repetition, drills.  I find myself wanting to practice by trying to think of the next big app or some other novel idea that few people have tried.  I seem to hold myself up waiting for this new inspiration, when in reality there is so much I could be doing to grow and to practice my skills. A large part of my recent push has been to focus on coding challenges and really drill on coding concepts and solving problems. I have been working on a different challenge on [exercism.io](http:www.exercism.io) over the past few days.  I am also planning to go back to my previous res [Project Euler Challenges](https://projecteuler.net/)
