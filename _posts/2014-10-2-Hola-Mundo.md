This is my first post using Jekyll.  I'm hoping to move all blogging related to working on code here.  I also want this to be a personal blog where I just post ideas and opinions, as well as fun things that happen from day to day.

I will also be seeding some old post from the recetera blog which I'm going to take down so that space can be dedicated to work on the app.
