Something that was bugging me was figuring out how to get URLs I type into my posts to be links. Well I came across [rails_autolink](https://github.com/tenderlove/rails_autolink).

This is one of the coolest things about the community. There is a common problem and people are getting together to fix it. I'm sure this is something that is very commonly used, but is completely new to me at this early stage.

Along the theme of something new every day, I am trying to learn something new on a daily basis, to grow little by little. Even if I'm busy all day and only have time to click through a tutorial for 15 min, I will do it. This is quickly becoming a passion for me and I haven't found something I enjoy this much in a while.
