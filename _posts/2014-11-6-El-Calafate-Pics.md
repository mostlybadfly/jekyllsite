El Calafate was beautiful. It was by far the best part of the trip for me.  It was a much needed getaway.  The landscape was breathtaking and unlike anything I've ever seen.  Even the view from the aiport was pretty.

This plant is the calafate plant.  According to a guide, this is the blueberry plant. I was also told that there is a local saying that he who has some calafate jam is destined to return.  I hope this is the case.
