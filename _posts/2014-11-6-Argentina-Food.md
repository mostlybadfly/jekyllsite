Though I didn't take as many shots as I would've liked, the food was incredible in Argentina. Below are a few I think are representative of what I had down there.

The above was a lunch we had in El Calafate: grilled ribeye, french fries, grilled morcilla, grilled lamb tripe, and a malbec to wash it all down.

Another dinner in El Calafate and my favorite meal: Ribeye with fried egg and roasted potatoes with creamed leeks. some pastas and roast lamb.  Again more malbec of course!

My favorite breakfast: empanadas and café con leche.

Because I love snacks and because I had to try some local junk food. This toasted bread snack was jamón ibérico flavored.  A bit bizarre, I liked them at first but the smell got to be a little much after a while.

Oreos favorite on an Argintinean favorite, alfajores.  This is basically just three oreo cookies with their filling and covered in chocolate.  I found it funny that they named it Trilogía after the three cookies. For some reason, it reminded me of how we label things as "EXTREME" here.

It was actually pretty delicious.
