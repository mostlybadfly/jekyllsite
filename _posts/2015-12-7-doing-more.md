It has been a few weeks since I last posted.  I've been up to various things including studying, contributing, working on my projects, and more cooking.  With winter coming up, I decided to take the next month or so as a break from applying to places and really focusing on just doing more.  This means making more whether it is programming or cooking related.  It also means stepping out of my comfort level and going to more meetups, and working on more pull requests for things I might not know how to do right away.  These are a few of the things I have been and want to work on during this winter:

A few weeks ago, someone on Twitter was looking for Spanish speakers to help contribute some translations to a project.  I later found out it was a project to help aspiring Spanish-speaking web developers learn about HTML tags and their meanings.  The project is called [LMHT(Lenguage de Marcas de Hipertexto)](https://lmht.github.io/). I really like the goal of this project and have really enjoyed contributing.  It has really helped me see how the things I can contribute can be of great help.  I'm looking forward to seeing it grow and contributing as much as I can to this.
