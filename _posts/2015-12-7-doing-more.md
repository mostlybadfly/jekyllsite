It has been a few weeks since I last posted.  I've been up to various things including studying, contributing, working on my projects, and more cooking.  With winter coming up, I decided to take the next month or so as a break from applying to places and really focusing on just doing more.  This means making more whether it is programming or cooking related.  It also means stepping out of my comfort level and going to more meetups, and working on more pull requests for things I might not know how to do right away.  These are a few of the things I have been and want to work on during this winter:

####*LMHT

####*Books to Read

####*Meetups

####*Giggle Water

####*Recetera
