Every year I'm always surprised that it is suddenly fall.  There is that moment where leaves are everywhere on the ground and it seems shocking.  I think Spring has a similar thing when you suddenly notice all the flowers are in bloom.

I walked around yesterday and just looked around, I love seeing the change. It reminds me of how things go through phases, how they age, how they keep going.

The flower pot at our front door finally got some use. I bought a big pumpkin to place in it to mark this surprise beginning of fall.
