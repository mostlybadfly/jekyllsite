I've been to 3 meetups int he past 2 weeks. I've always wanted to do this but never had to guts to meet new people. The first meetup was the Chicago LGBT in Tech group, then I went to the Project Euler Sprint, and yesterday I went to Chicago Ruby. All of these groups have been very welcoming and had a great time learning and meeting people.

These have all motivated me to keep going and to keep letting my curiosity guide me. It has been a bit difficult not having a direct path or project to work on but I am very much enjoying picking up bits and pieces when I can.
