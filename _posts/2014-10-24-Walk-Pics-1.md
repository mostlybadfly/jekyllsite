  I always try to take time during the day to take a long walk somewhere.  Usually it is so I can run another errand or play Ingress, but I also really enjoy just looking around and noticing the little interesting things all around.  One of my favorite things to keep an eye out for are various stickers, paste ups, or various other forms of street art around Chicago.  This is probably the majority of what makes me stop and take a picture.

  Below are a few I took this week:
