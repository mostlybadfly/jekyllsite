I took somewhat of a break from blogging over the Winter. I slowed down a bit in terms of my learning process and seeking opportunities.  I was feeling a bit discouraged about my progress and if I'd ever move on to something new.  I took a somewhat conscious step of not worrying so much and just letting things come naturally.  I can say that even though I haven't been super active in terms of coding and development, I am a lot more comfortable with where I am.  

Today is seems to be the first day in a series of warmer weather, I figure it is time to provide an update and look forward to the spring ahead. So what have I been doing?

#### Cooking

  I've been very proud of some of the dishes I made over the winter.  Understandably, there was a focus on soups and stews.  Here are some of the things I've made over the past few months:
