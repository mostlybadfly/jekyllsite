I took somewhat of a break from blogging over the Winter. I slowed down a bit in terms of my learning process and seeking opportunities.  I was feeling a bit discouraged about my progress and if I'd ever move on to something new.  I took a somewhat conscious step of not worrying so much and just letting things come naturally.  I can say that even though I haven't been super active in terms of coding and development, I am a lot more comfortable with where I am.  

Today is seems to be the first day in a series of warmer weather, I figure it is time to provide an update and look forward to the spring ahead. So what have I been doing?

### Cooking

  I've been very proud of some of the dishes I made over the winter.  Understandably, there was a focus on soups and stews.  Here are some of the things I've made over the past few months:
  
  * [Puerco Guisado en Leche con Frijoles y Chochoyotes](http://www.comalcaliente.com/2015/12/puerco-guisado-en-leche-con-frijoles.html)
  * [Two Soups, One Broth](http://www.comalcaliente.com/2016/01/two-soups-one-broth.html)
  * [Random Casserole](http://www.comalcaliente.com/2016/01/random-casserole.html)
  * [Guisado de Puerco](http://www.comalcaliente.com/2016/01/guisado-de-puerco.html)
  * [New Salsa](http://www.comalcaliente.com/2016/02/new-salsa.html)
  * [Lamb Birria Ramen](http://www.comalcaliente.com/2016/02/lamb-birria-ramen.html)
  * [Leftover Fideo Soup](http://www.comalcaliente.com/2016/02/leftover-fideo-soup.html)

### Recetera

  I recently made a few more updates to Recetera.  The biggest change has been updating recipes to wither be "Published" or Unpublished".  That is to say a user can choose to have their recipe be part of the main recipe list, or only have it show underneath their profile under "Unpublished Recipes".  This is a little on how I accomplished this:
  
  
  
### Cryptopals

  This is something I keep going back to and I recently am on another kick.  I realized that I didn't actually save my response to challenge 6 of set 1, this required a lot of refactoring and basically doing the challenge all over again.  It was almost a good thing I didn't fully right it down, because it put me in a place where I had to play around with Ruby a lot to make sure I was getting the responses necessary to solve it.  Here are a few things I learned as a result:
