Today I worked some more on the to do list app.  I wanted to add a default value to the `:done` attribute so that any time a new task is created it is flagged as not yet completed.  I liked the logic of doing this rather than leaving it as nil, but also I wanted to use the value to use in my model.

{% highlight ruby %}
class AddDefaultToDoneAttribute < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    change_column_default(:tasks, :done, false)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

With this migration set, each new record created will return `:done => false`.  After this, I added a `pending?` method to the model to check if there exist any created tasks that have `:done` set to `false`.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :title, presence: true

  def self.pending?
    self.where(:done => false).any?
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now if i utilize this, I can get a boolean response to the question if there are any pending tasks.  Finally, I utilized this method in order to display a table pending tasks or a message informing the user that there are no pending tasks.

{% highlight erb %}
<% if @tasks.pending? %>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Task</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
      <th class = "donebtn" >Done?</th>
    </tr>
    <% @tasks.each do |t| %>
        <% if t.done == false %>
            <tr>
              <td class = "tasknote"><%= t.title %></td>
              <td class = "tasknote"><%= t.note %></td>
              <td class = "donebtn">
                <%= link_to "Done", complete_tasks_path(:id => t.id), class: "link" %>
              </td>
            </tr>
        <% end %>
    <% end %>
  </table>
<% else %>
  <p> There are no pending tasks! </p>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

I have much more to do but I like where this is going so far.  I'm going to add a user model next along with more refactoring where necessary.
