Hello! As you might already know, I'm an avid cook. I love looking at a set of given ingredients and figuring out what I can make with it.  It allows me to solve a problem while being creative. It is something that I can share with others and perhaps put a smile on their face. It makes me happy to come up with something different, see the end result, and hopefully make someone happy in the process.

I feel like much of what appeals to me about cooking is what draws me to programming. Being able to take my base knowledge and to build on it to improve and explore other tools and methods for creating the end result.  For me it is a way of expressing myself and impacting the world around me. One of my first interests in learning to program has been to create a recipe management app to help me keep track of and take notes on dishes I make. I have become fascinated by programming languages and development.
