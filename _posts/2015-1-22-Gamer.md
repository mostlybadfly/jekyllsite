Right before the new year I applied to my first programming job.  I was pretty nervous and unsure, but ultimately I'm glad I did it for multiple reasons.  Most importantly, it was empowering to know I can finally take that leap and start putting myself out there.  I was able to get past the phone call and was given the coding challenge.  It was definitely a challenge for me but was happy I was able to at least have working code. Unfortunately, I didn't get past this point, but as a result I got some great feedback from some good friends and feel like I came out better as a result.

Inspired by this feedback, I decided to dig up an old simple ruby program I was playing around with when I first started.  I wanted to polish it up, use more idiomatic language, and practice with more focus on OOP. The program basically takes user input through a text file, processes the commands given and displays the result.  Being that I'm a fan of videogames, I thought that this would be fun to use this as the topic. To begin, I wrote up some tests before each functionality I wanted to create:  

{% highlight ruby %}
describe Gamer do
  describe '#add' do
    it 'adds a new game' do
      input_file = File.open("input.txt", "r")
      gamer = Gamer.new(input_file)
      gamer.parse_input
      expect(gamer.games.first).to be_a(Game)
    end
  end

  describe '#update' do
    it 'updates an existing game' do
      input_file = File.open("input.txt", "r")
      gamer = Gamer.new(input_file)
      gamer.parse_input
      expect(gamer.games.first.year).to eq('1995')
    end
  end

  describe '#delete' do
    it 'deletes an existing game' do
      input_file = File.open("input.txt", "r")
      gamer = Gamer.new(input_file)
      gamer.parse_input
      expect(gamer.get_game('Shaq-fu')).to be_nil
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

In my tests, the Gamer class is being initialized with the `input_file` which contains the following commands:

```
  Add Earthbound 1996 SNES
```
```
  
  Update Earthbound 1995 SNES
```
```
  
  Add Shaq-fu 1994 SNES
```
```
  
  Delete Shaq-fu
```
```
  
  Show
```

This input gets pushed through to `Gamer#parse_input` which will split the string and interpret the first index as the command.  From there it pushes it to one of the methods I plan to set up:

{% highlight ruby %}
def parse_input
  @input.readlines.each do |line|
    command, *args = line.split

    case command.downcase
    when "add"
      add(args)
    when "update"
      update(args)
    when "delete"
      delete(args)
    when "show"
      show
    else
      raise "Error: invalid command #{ command }."
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

For `Gamer#add` I use the additional arguments to initialize a `Game` class and push this to an array to be used later:

{% highlight ruby %}
def add(args)
  name, year, system = args
  @games << Game.new(name, year, system)
end
{% endhighlight %}

From here, I can use my array of games to find a specific title that I want to work with.  This is is useful for `Gamer#update` and `Gamer#delete`.  To accomplish this I use `Gamer#get_game` which will find a game in my array based on the name parameter:

{% highlight ruby %}
def get_game(name)
  @games.find { |game| game.name == name }
end
{% endhighlight %}

Using this the `Gamer#update` and `Gamer#delete` are pretty straightforward:

{% highlight ruby %}
def update(args)
  name, year, system = args
  @game = get_game(name)
  @game.year = year
end

def delete(args)
  name, year, system = args
  @game = get_game(name)
  @games.delete @game
end
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, `Gamer#show` will display all of our games, which I print out in this format:

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  puts "Your List of games:"
  @games.each_with_index do  |game, id|
    id += 1  
    puts "#{id}.) #{game.name} | #{game.year} | #{game.system}"
    puts "...thank you!"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Some doubts I still have/Things I want to work on:
- Not sure why I need to have all arguments pass through `Gamer#delete` in order for it to actually remove the game.  `#delete(name)` alone doesn't seem to do it.
- I would like to add a rating system and perhaps a System class so that I can reference games belonging to a system or add more functionality from there.
- Any additions or suggestions from others ([checkout the github repo](https://github.com/mostlybadfly/gamer))

Rewriting this program has been a great joy and very relaxing. It was very nice just sitting on a weekend and writing pure ruby.  Currently I am continuing work on a recipe app in rails.  I am considering writing a similar program in pure Ruby first just meditate on what I want the app to do, relax and get more more more practice!.
