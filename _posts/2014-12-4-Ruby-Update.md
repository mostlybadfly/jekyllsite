title: Update On Some Things I've Been Doing.

It has been a fairly distracting few weeks since the trip to Argentina.  I wanted to give an update to share some of the things I've been working on.

*Vim*

After going from Caret to Atom and various ways of editing files, I finally decided to give in and use Vim.  I think the perceived learning curve is what held me back.  I must admit, I'm not a power user yet, but I do feel that is very fast and an effective way to work on code.  It has become my preferred method now and I feel more connected with what Iâ€™m working on in this way.  I haven't had to work on a full on project in Rails to see how I can deal with navigating multiple directories.  In either case I like the flow of it and am convinced I will be sticking with this going forward.

*Matasano Crypto Challenges* 

Though I have only gotten through the first four challenges in the first set, I have been able to find various lines of code to refactor.  I love working on these and have had fun figuring them out in Ruby. I feel like I have learned a lot about programming so far.  This also just helps me further understand cryptography and real life ways in which information can be manipulated and picked though.

One thing to add is I'm writing RSpec tests to check for the desired replies in the challenges.  It isn't extremely important but I figured this would be a good way to learn more about how to write these tests.

*Shoes*

I played around with Shoes for a bit and created a small graphical app.  It was really fun to see how you can create the gui in familiar Ruby syntax.  The true payoff was seeing the app in action on my computer.  I will have to create more complex examples in this.

*Rails* 

Grr, this one is still giving me some trouble.  I for some reason have been enjoying just tinkering with Ruby and making things here and there, but I have not progressed much with building a Rails app. I feel like I have been fairly competent in creating very basic apps to get an idea of where things are moving.  However, I think it is time to completely push through some of the tutorials I have to get a real feel for how things are working, all the way to fruition.

*Apprenticeship*

Taking the plunge and putting together some examples and improving some skills to finally take this step.  I feel that I'm at a place where I can see how this is a possibility.  The next month will be dedicated to getting this and moving on.  Hopefully this will all work out so wish me luck!
