Hola! I'm Daniel.  I am an avid home cook and live in Chicago with my husband Drew. I am teaching myself Ruby and Rails and have become a huge fan.  I am always looking to connect with other rubyist and explore new opportunities.  Apart from code, I love food, and puppy kisses from my crazy chocolate lab, Porter.

### More Information

Here you will find a variety of things, from my experiences learning about web development and the tech industry to thoughts on living in chicago, music, food, videogames.  I hope for this to be a journal of sorts related to various aspects of my day.
